### Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. What are the most common languages, framework, and databases used by professionals in Nigeria
2. What are the most want work languages and framework by professionals in Nigeria
3. Which programming language has the highest job satisfaction

### File Descriptions
The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.

### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@ayemonisanolubukola/what-are-the-most-common-programming-languages-used-in-nigeria-a2d3f3ecc4bc)

### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
